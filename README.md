Some Heurstics concepts within the app

1. Visibility of system status
The card will display a refresh symbol if the pages needs to be refreshed or a status page error will pop up informing them that an error has occured and that they may need to refresh the page.


3. User Control and Freedom
The navigation bar gives the user freedom to navigate between the pages.


5. Error Prevention
Status pages has the error code placed in the bottom right of the message box with text that describes the problem.

6. Recognition rather than recall

8. Aesthetic and miniamlist design
Minimalistic nav bar. Straight to the point to inform users of what is where.
